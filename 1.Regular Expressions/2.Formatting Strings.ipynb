    "### What is string formatting?\n",
    "\n",
    "String formatting is also called string interpolation. It is the process of inserting a custom string in a predefined text. As data scientist, you will use it to insert a title in a graph, show an error message or pass a statement into a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods for formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "The modern versions of Python have three main approaches to string formatting: \n",
    "\n",
    "- positional formatting, \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- formatted strings literals, and \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- template methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positional formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional formatting works in the following way. We put placeholders defined by a pair of curly braces in a text. We call the string dot format method. Then, we pass the desired value into the method. The method replaces the placeholders using the values in order of appearance. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pf.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine the example. We define a string and insert two placeholders. We pass two strings to the method which will be passed to get the following output. We can use variables for both the string and the values passed to the method. "
