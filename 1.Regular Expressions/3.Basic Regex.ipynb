    "### What is a regular expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression, or regex, is a string that contains a combination of normal and special characters that describes patterns to find text within a text. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds very complicated. Let's break it down to understand it better. Here, we have an example of what a regular expression looks like. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"re.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `r` at the beginning indicates a raw string. It is always advisable to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that a regex contains normal characters, or literal characters we already know. The normal characters match themselves. In the case shown, `st` exactly matches an `s` followed by a `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "They also contain special characters.` Metacharacters` represent `types of characters`. Let's look one by one. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\d` represents a `digit`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\s` represents a `whitespace`,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\w`  represents a `word character`.They also represent ideas, such as location or quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, 3 and 10 inside curly braces indicates that the character immediately to the left, in this case backslash w, should appear between 3 and 10 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that regex describes a pattern. A pattern is a sequence of characters that maps to words or punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, you will use pattern matching \n",
    "\n",
    "- To find and replace specific text. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To validate strings such as passwords or email addresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why use regex? They are very powerful and fast. They allow you to search complex patterns that would be very difficult to find otherwise."
