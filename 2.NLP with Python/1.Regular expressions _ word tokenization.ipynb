    "### What is tokenization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of transforming a string or document into smaller chunks, which we call tokens. This is usually one step in the process of preparing a text for natural language processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different theories and rules regarding tokenization, and you can create your own tokenization rules using regular expresssions, but normally tokenization will do things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- break out words or sentences, \n",
    "\n",
    "- often separate punctuation or \n",
    "\n",
    "- you can even just tokenize parts of a string like separating all hashtags in a Tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why tokenize?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why bother with tokenization? Because it can help us with some simple text processing tasks like mapping part of speech, matching common words and perhaps removing unwanted tokens like common words or repeated words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### nltk library\n",
    "\n",
    "One library that is commonly used for simple tokenization is nltk, the natural language toolkit library. Here is a short example of using the word_tokenize method to break down a string into tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"n.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the result that words are separated and punctuation are individual tokens as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other nltk tokenizers\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond just tokenizing words, NLTK has plenty of other tokenizers you can use. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `sent_tokenize` function will `split a document into individual sentences`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `regexp_tokenize` uses `regular expressions to tokenize the string`, giving you more granular control over the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `TweetTokenizer` does neat things like recognize hashtags, mentions and when you have too many punctuation symbols following a sentence."

    "- Write a new pattern called `pattern6` to match `mentions` and `hashtags`. A mention is something like `@DataCamp`. Then, call `regexp_tokenize()` with your new hashtag pattern on the `last tweet` in tweets and assign the result to `mentions_hashtags`. You can access the last element of a list using -1 as the index, for example, tweets[-1]. Print `mentions_hashtags`\n",
